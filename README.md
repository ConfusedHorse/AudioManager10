# AudioManager10

## PROJECT IS REDUNDANT: due to a recent Windows10 update which provides this exact functionality there will be no further updates to this project. Feel free to use this code as an example of basic audio access though.

An alternative custom control which provides basic audio management functionality, such as volume handling or default device selection
